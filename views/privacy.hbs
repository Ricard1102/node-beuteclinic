          </h4>
          <p>To collect the information in the “Information We Automatically Collect” section above, we and our service providers
            use Internet server logs, cookies, tags, SDKs, tracking pixels, and other similar tracking technologies. A web
            server log is a file where website activity is stored. An SDK is a section of code that we embed in our applications
            and software to allow third parties to collect information about how users interact with the services. A cookie
            is a small text file that is placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a site, that enables us
            to: (i) recognize your computer and login session; (ii) store your preferences and settings; (iii) understand
            which web pages of the services you have visited; (iv), enhance your user experience by delivering and measuring
            the effectiveness of content and advertising tailored to your interests; (v) perform analytics; and (vi) assist
            with security and administrative functions. Tracking pixels (sometimes referred to as web beacons or clear GIFs)
            are tiny electronic tags with a unique identifier embedded in websites, online ads and/or email, and that are
            designed to provide usage information like ad impressions or clicks, email open rates, measure popularity of
            the services and associated advertising, and to access user cookies. As we adopt additional technologies, we
            may also gather information through other methods. Please note that you can change your settings to notify you
            when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the “Help” section of your
            browser for more information (e.g., Internet Explorer; Google Chrome; Mozilla Firefox; or Apple Safari).

            services to you on non- {{company}} websites. Or a third-party ad network might collect information on the services
            and other websites to develop a profile of your interests and target advertisements to you based on your online

            </li>
            <li>Business Transfers: If the ownership of all or substantially all of our business changes, we may transfer your
              information to the new owner so that the services can continue to operate. In such case, your information would
              remain subject to the promises and commitments contained in this Privacy Policy until such time as this Privacy
              Policy is updated or amended by the acquiring party upon notice to you. If such transfer is subject to additional
              mandatory restrictions under applicable laws, {{company}} will comply with such restrictions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Public Forums: The services make it possible for you to upload and share comments or feedback publicly (i.e., outside of
              the {{company}} mobile and web app) with other users, such as on the {{company}} social media, blogs etc. Any
              information that you submit through such public features is not confidential, and {{company}} may use it for
              any purpose (including in testimonials or other {{company}} marketing materials). Any information you post
              openly in these ways will be available to the public at large and potentially accessible through third-party
              search engines. Such information can be read, collected and/or used by other users, and it could be used to

          </ul>
          <h4>YOUR CHOICES
          </h4>
          <p>We provide you with a number of choices with respect to the information we collect and use as discussed throughout

            your interests by contacting us at any time. In commercial email messages, you can also opt out by following
            the instructions located at the bottom of such emails. Please note that, regardless of your request, we may still
            use and share certain information as permitted by this Privacy Policy or as required by applicable law. For example,
            you may not opt out of certain operational or service-related emails, such as those reflecting our relationship
            or transactions with you but we have to retain your medical records for a period shorter than seven years.
          </p>
          <h4>THIRD PARTY LINKS AND SERVICES

            If you choose to use these sites or integrations, you may disclose your information not just to those third-parties,
            but also to their users and the public more generally depending on how their services function. Because these

            or practices of those websites or services. The collection, use, and disclosure of your personal and other information
            will be subject to the privacy policies of the third party websites or services, and not this Policy. We urge
            you to read the privacy and security policies of these third-partys.

          </h4>
          <p>
            Our services are available to all ages. For children under 16, we may need to get consent from someone with parental responsibility.

            order for the child; − a local authority designated to care for the child; or − a local authority or person with
            an emergency protection order for the child. However, some children under 16 can give consent if they can fully
            understand the information given to them. This is known as ‘Gillick competence’.

            regarding this privacy policy should first contact {{company}} at: {{mail}}. We may transfer information that
            we collect about you to third party processors across international borders and outside the EU. These third parties
            may have access to your information for the limited purpose of providing the service we have contracted with
            them to provide. They are required to have a privacy policy and security standards in place that are at least
            as protective of your information as is this Privacy Policy (including those provisions related to compliance
            with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield). {{company}} will take reasonable and appropriate steps necessary
            to ensure that any third party who is acting as a “data processor” under EU and Swiss terminology is processing
            the personal information we entrust to them in a manner that is consistent with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy
            Shield Principles.

            to the processing of your information, please contact us using the contact information below. You may have to
            make a ‘Subject Access Request’. This is covered in the ICO’s Subject Access Policy which is available on request.
            Where you have provided consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness
            of the processing that was carried out prior to withdrawing your consent. If you are dissatisfied with the way
            we process your information, you may lodge a complaint with the ICO (Information Commissioner’s Office) the UK’s
            independent body set up to uphold information rights.
          </p>
          <h4>HOW LONG WE STORE YOUR INFORMATION
          </h4>

          <h4>CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY
          </h4>
          <p>We reserve the right to amend this Policy at any time to reflect changes in the law, our data collection and use
